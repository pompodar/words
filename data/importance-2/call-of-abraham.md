The story of Israel’s religion begins when, after the destruction of the Tower of Babel and the dispersal of the human race into separate countries with their differing languages, God calls Abram1 to leave Haran in northern Mesopotamia and to migrate to a country where God will multiply Abram’s offspring and make them a blessing for the other peoples of the world. The remainder of Genesis describes the fortunes of Abra(ha)m’s family.

Most scholars place Abraham somewhere in the early to mid-second millennium BCE, though specific dates vary considerably:
<br>
Kitchen argues for placing Abraham in the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000-1800 BCE):
"The most satisfactory dating for the patriarchal age remains the early second millennium BC, within c. 2000-1750 BC... the total cultural framework fits that period better than any other." (Kitchen, K.A., "The Patriarchal Age: Myth or History?" Biblical Archaeology Review, 1995)
<br>
Finkelstein takes a more minimalist approach:
"There is no clear historical evidence for the existence of Abraham and the patriarchs outside the biblical text... the patriarchal narratives were likely composed in the first millennium BCE and reflect that period rather than the second millennium." (Finkelstein, I. and Silberman, N.A., "The Bible Unearthed," 2001)
<br>
William F. Albright, a prominent 20th-century archaeologist and biblical scholar, suggested that the patriarchal narratives reflect the world of the early second millennium BCE (circa 2000-1700 BCE). This would place Abraham's call within this timeframe. However, more recent scholarship has shown that some of the cultural elements Albright used to date this period were more widespread and not limited to that specific era (Feldman, COJS).
<br>
Books on Old Testament history and archaeology, such as those by John Bright (A History of Israel) or more recent works on the archaeology of the Levant during the Bronze Age, would discuss the patriarchal period in relation to the archaeological record, often placing Abraham's floruit (and thus his call) in the early to middle Bronze Age (c. 2200-1550 BCE). These books would discuss the challenges of precise dating.
<br>
Scholars working with biblical chronology often follow different methods:
<br>
Thiele's chronology system, as expanded by subsequent scholars:
"Working backwards from firmly established dates and following biblical chronological markers places Abraham's call around 2091 BCE." (Ray, P.J., "The Date of Abraham's Call," Andrews University Seminary Studies, 2003)
<br>
Young suggests:
<br>
"The biblical data, when analyzed carefully, suggests Abraham received his call around 2166 BCE." (Young, R.C., "The Patriarchal Age: A Chronological Study," Bible and Spade, 2004)
<br>
"Jewish tradition, following rabbinic calculations in Seder Olam Rabbah, places Abraham's birth in 1948 after Creation (approximately 1812 BCE in conventional dating)." (Sarna, N., "Understanding Genesis," 1970)
