The Bible begins with the creation of the universe and of the human race. The opening chapters of Genesis describe various acts of human disobedience in regard to God, and of inhuman behaviour towards other humans. A universal flood (the biblical traditions have much in common with other flood stories from ancient Mesopotamia) destroys all but the family of Noah and the animals preserved by him in the ark, but the attempt at a new beginning for the human race after the flood fails.

Many traditional religious perspectives calculated specific dates for creation based on biblical genealogies:

**James Ussher's Chronology (17th century):**
"The beginning of time, according to our chronology, happened at the start of the evening preceding the 23rd day of October in the year 4004 BCE." (Ussher, J., "Annals of the World," 1650).  

**Jewish Calendar Tradition:**
"According to the rabbinic calculation in Seder Olam Rabbah, Creation occurred in 3761 BCE, which forms the basis of the Jewish calendar still in use today." (Kantor, M., "The Jewish Time Line Encyclopedia," 1992).

**Byzantine Calendar:**
"The Byzantine era places Creation at 5509 BCE, which remained the official calendar of the Byzantine Empire until its fall." (Grumel, V., "La Chronologie," 1958)
